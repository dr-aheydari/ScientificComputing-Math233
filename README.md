# Scientific Computing (Graduate Course: Math233)
This repository hosts the code for the PhD level Scientific Computing course, which I will be updating as the I complete the course.


## Repo Breakdown:

### HWs: 
This folder includes the files for "homeworks" turned in, either in parts or full (since some parts are LaTeXed).

### Labs:
Contains all labs for the course, either in parts or complete (marked at the end of each script with `#Par` or `#Fin`, respectively)

### Projects: 
Includes the final project for the course, which is about smart batching of data in deep learning via `CUDA` on multiple GPUs (more details to come in the near future)

## Usage: 

This repository may contain material that have been turned-in as an assignment or project for the purposes of course completion or research project, which means contents used from this repo could be considered as plagirism. 

## Contact Info:

For any questions or concerns, please contact me via [email](mailto:aliheydari@ucdavis.edu)
